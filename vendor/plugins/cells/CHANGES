- 2.3
  * Cell::Base#new(controller, opts={})

  * when a state view couldn't be found there's no longer a warning message, but an exception.
  * moved Cell::Base to lib/cell/base.rb
  * moved Rails extension code to lib/rails_extensions.rb
  * removed all the boot code since we don't need it anymore

  * added support for helpers in cell views
  * removed Cell::Registry in favor or a new cells autoloading mechanism
